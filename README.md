1. Building reusable UI components in React

- component composition & patterns
- class vs functional components
- hooks & lifecycle methods
- managing component props & state - controlled vs uncontrolled props

2. Styling for React components and apps

- current ecosystem + available options (sass, css-in-js, css variables, etc)

3. Application architecture - state management and application performance

- using context/redux/other options - you might not need redux
- routing, lazy loading
- performance considerations

4. Testing with React

- jest
- unit vs integration/end-to-end testing with jest + puppeteer

5. Tooling & deployment

- build tools, bundling & bundle size considerations, tree-shaking
- babel, webpack, parcel bundler, typescript, nextjs, create-react-app
- deployment & immutable web apps (caching, asset management, deployment strategies, etc)
- managing dependencies with npm/yarn
- effectively using npm scripts

Concurrent rendering - I suggest we leave this out for the moment, as there are not too many details published about this
