## 3. Testing with React

- jest
- unit vs integration/end-to-end testing with jest + puppeteer

## 4. Application architecture - state management and application performance

- using context/redux/other options - you might not need redux
- routing, lazy loading
- performance considerations

## 5. Tooling & deployment

- build tools, bundling & bundle size considerations, tree-shaking
- babel, webpack, parcel bundler, typescript, nextjs, create-react-app
- deployment & immutable web apps (caching, asset management, deployment strategies, etc)
- managing dependencies with npm/yarn
- effectively using npm scripts
